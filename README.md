#I am a passionate and dedicated software developer with a 5-year journey of self-taught exploration in the world of software #development. My expertise lies in modern JavaScript technologies, including frameworks and libraries like Angular, React.js, and React #Native, which I use to build dynamic web and mobile applications.

#As a full-stack developer, I have hands-on experience with backend technologies, including Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, enabling me to #create scalable, end-to-end solutions.

#I also follow clean coding and design principles, embracing methodologies such as Clean Architecture, MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), and #Dependency Injection to ensure my work is modular, maintainable, and user-centric. My passion lies in delivering seamless and impactful #digital experiences through thoughtful design and efficient code.
