I am a passionate and dedicated Full stack developer with a 7-year journey of self-taught exploration in the world of software development. My expertise lies in modern JavaScript technologies, including frameworks and libraries such as Next.js, Angular, React.js, and React Native, which I use to build dynamic web and mobile applications.

As a full-stack developer, I have hands-on experience with backend technologies, including Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, enabling me to create scalable, end-to-end solutions.

## Portfolio:

Please check out some of my live projects at [https://dev.phenyo.vercel.app](https://dev.phenyo.vercel.app)

## Currently:

I’m working on a productivity desktop application word processor called LightDocs. Think Microsoft Word but lighter.  I'm building it with Tauri which is a combination of web technologies for the frontend and Rust for the backend. This will be my very first native desktop application so it might take a while as I'm still learning and building. Di comeback to track progress as I update this every month.

## Currently Learning:


--       C#: I’m deepening my understanding of C# to build more robust backend systems and improve my proficiency in object-oriented 
         programming. C# is widely used in developing enterprise applications and games, which aligns with my goal to enhance my backend 
          development skills.

--      Cloud Deployment: I’m learning how to deploy applications to the cloud using services like AWS, Azure, and Heroku. Cloud 
        deployment is essential for scaling applications, ensuring high availability, and enhancing performance, especially in modern web 
         applications and e-commerce solutions.

--     CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment): I’m gaining expertise in setting up automated CI/CD pipelines to streamline 
       development workflows, automate testing, and deploy applications reliably. CI/CD improves efficiency by reducing manual 
       intervention and speeding up the delivery process.

--    Docker: I’m exploring Docker to containerize applications, making them easier to deploy across different environments. Docker 
      simplifies application distribution and ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

---  Kubernetes (K8S): I’m learning Kubernetes to manage containerized applications at scale. Kubernetes is a powerful tool for 
     orchestrating, scaling, and automating the deployment of applications, especially in microservices architectures.
